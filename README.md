## STL Utilities

Reminants of a senior project from Cal Poly, SLO. These STL utility files were used to generate 3d models of iPhone cases and other projects from black and white image files that represented either raised or negative space. Written in C for speed - previews were generated quickly for a web interface. May or may not work - contact @ChrisPolis for inquiries.
